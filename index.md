**Zhiwei Chen** (陈智威) was born in Dazhou of Sichuan province, China. I am now a visiting postdoc in the Group of Relativistic Astrophysics, Institute for Theoretical Physics at Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany.

Meanwhile, I also hold the  postdoc position in the Group of Three Dimensional Structure of Milky Way, National Astronomical Observatories, China. I am interested in all fields of theoretical astrophysics, especially in multimessenger astronomy.
