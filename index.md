**Zhiwei Chen** (陈智威) was born in Dazhou of Sichuan province, China. I am now a PHD student in the Group of Gravitational Wave Astrophysics of National Astronomical Observatories of China, Chinese academy of Sciences. I am interested in all fields of theoretical astrophysics, especially in Gravitational Wave and High Energy physics.
